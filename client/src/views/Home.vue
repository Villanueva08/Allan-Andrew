MANILA, Philippines – The Philippines' crucifixion reenactments will be canceled this year as coronavirus cases climb, said authorities in the city where the annual tourist spectacle is held.

About a dozen Catholics regularly have themselves nailed to wooden crosses on Good Friday as penance for their sins. The event attracts thousands of tourists.

This year's rituals were planned for farming villages around San Fernando city, north of the capital Manila on April 10, but local officials have stopped the event to prevent mass gatherings and a potential spread of the virus.

"We are not disrespecting religious beliefs and practices, but we actually are protecting them from the disease that may put them and their family at risk," San Fernando Mayor Edwin Santiago said in a statement.

Philippine health authorities said Wednesday, March 11, 49 people have tested positive for the virus in the country, up by 16 from a day earlier. A Chinese traveler, one of the country's earliest cases, later died.
